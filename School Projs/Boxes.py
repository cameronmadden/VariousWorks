#  File: Boxes.py

#  Description: This program takes a list of length n of boxes and determines which boxes fit
# 	within each other. After doing so, it returns the largest number of boxes that can fit within 
# 	one of the boxes along with the number of possible set of boxes that would be possible 
# 	in that combination.
